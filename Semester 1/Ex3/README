Near the end, when the user guess the right number, the program will give him a grade.
At the end the program ask the user if he wants to play again.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3c.cc –o ex3c
Run: ex3c

Input:
a. Receive a number to build a range.
b. Receive a guessing numbers.
c. Receive a number to play or not to play another game.

Output:
a. Print if the guesses are too big or too small.
