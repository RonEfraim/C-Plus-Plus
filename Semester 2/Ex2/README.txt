Remove even numbers in a linked list
=============================================================
Written by: Ron Efraim, id = 204661425, login = ronef

The program receives from user numbers until eof. 
Then the program checks for each structure in the list if it is odd or even.
The program removes the even numbers from the list
Finally, the program summon a function that print the list.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex2a.cc –o ex2a
Run: ex2a

input:
  a. Numbers until eof.
 
output:
  a. The linked list without the even numbers.

Pointer to the next even or odd in the list
=============================================================

The program receives from user numbers until eof.
Then the program checks for each cell in the list if it is odd or even.
The program connects with a pointer between the evens and the same action for the odd.
Finally, the program summon a function that print the list.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex2b.cc –o ex2b
Run: ex2b

input:
  a. Numbers until eof.
 
output:
  a. The first node in list and then next odd or even.

Linked List
=============================================================
Written by: Ron Efraim, id = 204661425, login = ronef

The program receives from user numbers until eof.
Then the program checks for each input its prime number.
The prime number enters to the first structure in line and the 
left linked structures contains the user's values that divide by the prime number.
The structures linked from the smallest to the biggest.
Each value exist only one time in the list.
Finally, the program summon a function that print the list.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex2c.cc –o ex2c
Run: ex2c

Input:
  a. Numbers until eof.

output:
  a. The linked list.
